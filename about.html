        This site is still under contruction, however,
        the premise for the site is personal page where
        I can sell homemade products as well as practice
        my development skills. Here you will find clean
        bones, plants, and flower pots. The bones come
        from my family's cattle and sheep ranch north of
        Austin. A few years back, I started collecting
        various bones and cleaning them to display and
        decoration.

        Gardening has a mild obsession of mine the last few
        years and so I often find myself gifting cuttings
        and propogations. Eventually my gardening and bones
        collecting became a fun combination in my home.
        Please feel free to browse the current listings
        or send an email if you have any questions about
        the products here.

        Best regards, and grim gardening my friends!
